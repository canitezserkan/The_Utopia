# Utopia

The idea was found by me for this program called Utopia and still an ongoing project which is contributed one of my friends who is name is Sabri Mor.
Project was imagined as a living virtual world where people can be born, marry with each other if it is suitable, or die as they're getting older. Program was designed in a way that as every specified period of time passed such as 10 minutes, one Utopian year passes. About 6 procedures have been created and many more will be for this purpose in MS SQL so they all will be executed for each Utopian year and random things will occur for the people on database.

Windows Forms Application and MS SQL is being used for this project.
Here is a youtube video link for demonstration about how the program works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8HXgnML4z4
